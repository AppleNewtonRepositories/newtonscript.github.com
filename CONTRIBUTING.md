CONTRIBUTING TO NewtonScript.org
================================

We welcome feedback, bug fixes, content & display improvements, and 
translations. Ultimately, what gets accepted and merged into the project is up 
to NewtonScript.org staff (specifically, Morgan Aldridge, the current project 
maintainer), but you are encouraged to submit your improvements.

WHAT YOU NEED
-------------

You will need the following to contribute:

* A [GithHub](http://github.com) account for submitting pull requests
* A familiarity with HTML5, CSS3 experience is a plus

MAKING CHANGES
--------------

You will need to do the following to make changes that are most likely to be
accepted with little headache and back & forth:

1. Fork the [newtonscript.github.com](https://github.com/NewtonScript/newtonscript.github.com) project on GitHub
2. Create a topic branch (an appropriately named branch regarding the intended changes, e.g. "new-license", "style-overhaul", or "resonsive-design-fixes") from the `master` branch
3. Make commits in logical units and with properly explanatory commit messages
4. Preview your changes in an HTML5-capable web browser to ensure nothing broke and everything is rendering appropriately.

SUBMITTING CHANGES
------------------

When you've completed your changes and are ready for them to be merged into the
main project, you can do the following to submit them for review and likely
inclusion in NewtonScript.org:

1. Push your changes to your fork of the newtonscript.github.com project on GitHub
2. Submit a pull request to the [newtonscript.github.com](https://github.com/NewtonScript/newtonscript.github.com) project

That's all there is to it. If you followed the "Making Changes" guidelines and 
the changes are aligned with the vision of the project, it should be a pretty 
smooth process to get them merged in.
