CONTRIBUTING TO NewtonScript.org
================================

We welcome feedback, bug fixes, content & display improvements, and translations. Ultimately, what gets accepted and merged into the project is up to NewtonScript.org staff (specifically, [Morgan Aldridge](https://github.com/morgant), the current project maintainer), but you are encouraged to submit any suggestions.

WHAT YOU NEED
-------------

You will need the following to contribute:

* A [GitHub](http://github.com) account for submitting pull requests
* A familiarity with HTML5, CSS3 experience is a plus

MAKING CHANGES
--------------

Follow these steps when making changes. That way, they will most likely be accepted with few headaches and very little back and forth.

1. Fork the [newtonscript.github.com](https://github.com/NewtonScript/newtonscript.github.com) project on GitHub.
2. Create a topic branch from the `master` branch. Name your branch appropriately, reflecting the intended changes. (e.g. “new-license”, “style-overhaul”, or “responsive-design-fixes”)
3. Make commits in logical units and with explanatory commit messages.
4. Preview your changes in an HTML5-capable web browser to ensure nothing is broken and everything is rendering correctly.

SUBMITTING CHANGES
------------------

When you’ve completed your changes and are ready to merge them into the main project, follow these steps to submit them for review.

1. Push the changes to your fork of the newtonscript.github.com project on GitHub
2. Submit a pull request to the [newtonscript.github.com](https://github.com/NewtonScript/newtonscript.github.com) project

That’s all there is to it.

If you followed the “Making Changes” guidelines and the changes are aligned with the vision of the project, it should be a smooth process to merged them.
